INTRO:

This is a simple TCL templating system. I wrote it, because I had to create many colvar configuration fiiles in the molecular dynmics program NAMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/).

USEAGE:

In your namd.conf file you have to add

source templating.tcl

Then you set the colvars config file using

colvarsConfig   [fill_template TEMPLATE_FILE_NAME OUT_FILE_NAME]

In the template all the variables defined in the namd conf file are accessible and are automatically replaced (you have to prefix them with a $, of course). You can also use flow control statements by prefiying the first line with %.
